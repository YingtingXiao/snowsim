grid node - ?
J in equation 6? the determinant of Fe
solve equation 9? conjugate gradient (because it's positive definite and symmetric)
mass symmetric - x'y -> x'my (another possible way: scale the system by the mass matrix) second particle is symmetric, m-1 is diagonal. multiplying both sides by m will make it symmetric
stopping conditions for CG: iteration, residural < 0.00004, absolute tolerance
reaching convergence is not very important
solver to use?
CG only gives you the right answer for symmetric matrices

particles communicate through grid
grid performs viscosity
extension to MAC grid
grid: less blurry advection - no damping
equation 11 - taylor expansion (no straight up velocity) - the critical equation

F is initialized to I
chris batty and bridson - fewer particles
conserving mass by having mass
27-64 particles per cell. grid doesnt have to be very high-res
